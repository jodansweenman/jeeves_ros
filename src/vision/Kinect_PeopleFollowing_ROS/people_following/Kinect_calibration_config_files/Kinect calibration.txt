How to use pre-existing calibration configuration file:

Place rgb_A00363A09076112A.yaml file into 
~/.ros/camera_info/
e.g. /home/mcecsbot/.ros/camera_info/


where rgb_A00363A09076112A is a serial number of specific camera.
Serial num is displayed during freenect_launch stdout output.

Note: only rgb camera calibration file is needed. 
No need for use of calibration file for depth (IR) camera: default is used.


To confirm correct configuration, run:
    rostopic echo /camera/rgb/camera_info
It should steam the Kinect's configuration parameters as set by .yaml file.
