People Detection And Tracking ROS node,
"open_ptrack" package installation scripts are in this directory:

open_ptrack_install_1.sh
open_ptrack_install_2.sh

To install open_ptrack package, just execute these scripts, 
assuming you have ROS Full Desktop installed and
catkin workspace directory exists (has been initialized).

If you get errors during execution of a second script, just
reboot the machine and execute second script, open_ptrack_install_2.sh again.

Detailed installation instructions are in Jeeves Robot Manual, on Wiki Docs.
