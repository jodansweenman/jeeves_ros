# This is a database containing MAC addresses with their respective coordinate locations.
# Coordinates are pre-translated for MRPT.

# Format is simply "MAC ADDRESS, x, y, z'/n'" so keep this in mind for parsing.
# A sorting mechanism should be considered for search performance during nav routine.

# ***NOTE z is not implemented yet.
