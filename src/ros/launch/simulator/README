To run a simulated turtlebot:

1) sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-turtlebot-simulator
2) roslaunch turtlebot_odom_only.launch

This starts a turtlebot simulation in Gazebo, running move_base, so you can give it navigation goals. 
Note: it's 'odom-only', so there's no odometry-correction running (i.e., no amcl).

3) ./visualizations.bash

This starts rviz, rqt_console, and rqt_plot.
