You have arrived at the face controller, congratulations.
This guy controls the expressions on the LED arrays that make up the 
eyes and mouth.
This is not to be confused with the head controller which controls
the head's physical position.

DIRECTORY STRUCTURE
    ./firmware/     -- the Arduino code for displaying the expression primitives

    ./nodes/        -- the python scripts that work the ROS magic (subscribing to topics, publishing, etc.)
    ./msg/          -- the messages this node can write
