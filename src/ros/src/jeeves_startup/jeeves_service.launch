<!--
# This file is designed to work with the robot_upstart package.
#
# The command 
#
#	rosrun robot_upstart install jeeves_startup/jeeves_service.launch
#
# copies this launch file to /etc/ros/indigo/jeeves.d, and creates an upstart
# job at /etc/init/jeeves.conf. 
# The upstart file waits for eth0 to come up, sets $ROS_IP and $ROS_URI_MASTER, 
# then kicks off the launch file. You can start and stop the jeeves service 
# in the usual way:
#
#	sudo service jeeves start
# or
#	sudo service jeeves stop
#
